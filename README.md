## Description

This Web Application allows user to get current and two day weather forecast. Simply type in a city name or zip code. The user can also click the 'search weather near me' button to get the current weather data nearby. This was accomplished using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap. Google places API auto completes the user inputs. Weatherapi.com was used as the data source. JavaScripts geolocation is used to get the coordinates for the user. See [How To Use](#how-to-use) section for an explanation of how it works.

Overall a fun and challenging project. I came away with a better understanding of incorporating APIs into a website.
